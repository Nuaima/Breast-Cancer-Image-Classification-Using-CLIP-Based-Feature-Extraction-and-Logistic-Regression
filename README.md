# 🩺 Breast Cancer Image Classification Using CLIP-Based Feature Extraction and Logistic Regression

## 📖 Overview
This repository presents a lightweight and interpretable pipeline for **breast cancer image classification**.  
We combine **CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining)** for semantic-rich image feature extraction with a **Logistic Regression** classifier to detect benign and malignant lesions using the **CBIS-DDSM** dataset.  

The goal is to demonstrate how foundation models like CLIP can be adapted to medical imaging with **minimal compute** and **no fine-tuning**.  

---

## 🎯 Motivation
- Traditional deep learning approaches are often **resource-intensive** and lack **interpretability**.  
- CLIP provides **generalized vision-language embeddings**, but remains underexplored in clinical tasks.  
- We address this gap by **extracting CLIP features** and feeding them into a **simple, explainable classifier**.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- **Dataset:** CBIS-DDSM, with **10,239 high-resolution mammograms** (benign, malignant, normal).  
- **Feature Extraction:** CLIP (**ViT-B/32**) used to embed images (zero-shot, no fine-tuning).  
- **Classifier:** Logistic Regression (one-vs-rest, L2 regularization).  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  
- **Experimental Setup:** 80-20 train-test split, 50 epochs, batch size 32.
